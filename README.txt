This is a readme file. Here's what you need to know:
This project is a piece of coursework for my first term in university.
It's the first moderately large program I've written in C#, and my first attempt at seriously using verion control to boot.

The aim is simple: read in data from a text file, store it in custom objects, then 
display and edit said objects in a custom GUI before committing them back to the database.

Famous last words for this project: "How hard can it be?"
